                <p class="description">Visual hierarchy is a pattern in the visual field wherein some elements tend to "stand out," 
                    or attract attention, more strongly than other elements, suggesting a hierarchy 
                    of importance. While it may occur naturally in any visual field, the term is most 
                    commonly used in design, where elements are 
                    intentionally designed to make some look more important than others.
                    When you enter the website you will be able to see a first instance of
                    one of these images where it shows a large advertisement for the car as the highlight with
                    other secondary images to the main car. By scrolling down you can
                    to see the different functions of the page.</p>

                <p class="description">The rule of thirds is a method used to divide images or graphics into 
                    nine thirds by creating an evenly spaced grid with three columns and three rows. 
                    Designers can create or imagine these guidelines to organize the elements of their design.
                    The asymmetry created when composing an image according to the rule of thirds is 
                    what makes it most striking. In the example, being closer to one of the edges, 
                    the eyes follow it. This creates a sensation of movement.</p>

                <p class="description">When page elements are close to each other, we call it visual unity. 
                    Visual units create less clutter on a page and give structure to the information displayed. 
                    It also means that information is more likely to be assimilated and remembered when it is 
                    in a related visual unit.
                    For example, in the image, the presentation information is displayed 
                    in the lower left margin. You will see that the title, a brief information 
                    and the link are in one unit, while the button to view a series of images is 
                    in the lower left corner.</p>
